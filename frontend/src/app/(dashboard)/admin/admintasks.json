This context efficiently fetches the current user's admin status by calling the `is_global_admin()` Supabase RPC function, wrapped with `react-query` for advanced data management.\n\n**Implementation Details & Completed Features:**\n\n### **1. `frontend/src/contexts/AdminContext.tsx` - Core Context Implementation**\n*   **AdminProvider with `react-query` Integration**: The context utilizes `@tanstack/react-query` for efficient caching and data management. The `useQuery` hook is configured with optimized settings (5 minutes stale time, 10 minutes cache time) to balance freshness and performance. It includes intelligent retry logic that avoids retrying on authentication errors and is enabled only when running in a browser environment (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`) to ensure SSR-safety.\n*   **Comprehensive `AdminContextValue` Interface**: The context provides `isAdmin: boolean | null` (the admin status), `isLoading: boolean` (loading state), `isError: boolean` (error state), `error: Error | null` (specific error object), and `refetch: () => void` (a function for manual data re-fetching).\n*   **Convenient Auxiliary Hooks**: Multiple hooks are provided for different consumption patterns:\n    *   `useAdmin()`: The primary hook returning all context values (`isAdmin`, `isLoading`, `isError`, `error`, `refetch`). Includes context usage validation.\n    *   `useIsAdmin()`: A simpler hook that directly returns a boolean indicating if the user is an admin.\n    *   `useAdminUI()`: A specific hook designed for UI components, providing `showAdminUI` (a boolean indicating if admin UI should be shown, considering loading/error states) and `adminStatus` (the raw admin status).\n\n### **2. `frontend/src/app/providers.tsx` - Global Layout Integration**\n*   The `AdminProvider` has been correctly integrated into the application's main provider hierarchy, specifically positioned within the `ReactQueryProvider`. This ensures global availability of the `AdminContext` to all components throughout the application.\n\n### **3. `frontend/src/components/AdminNavigation.tsx` - Demo Component: Admin Navigation**\n*   A complete dropdown menu component (`AdminNavigation`) has been implemented for administrative navigation. It displays links to various admin-specific pages (Dashboard, Users, Articles, Applications, Settings) and provides clear visual feedback for loading, error, and success states using icons and badges.\n\n### **4. `frontend/src/components/AdminStatusBadge.tsx` - Demo Component: Admin Status Badge**\n*   A reusable visual badge component (`AdminStatusBadge`) has been created to indicate the user's admin status. It features distinct visual states for loading, error, and confirmed admin status, making it suitable for quick status display anywhere in the application.\n\n### **5. `frontend/src/components/AdminOnlyContent.tsx` - Demo Component: Conditional Content Wrapper**\n*   A versatile wrapper component (`AdminOnlyContent`) allows for showing or hiding content based on the user's admin status. It supports an optional fallback content prop, making it simple to use for conditional rendering: `<AdminOnlyContent fallback={<div>Access denied</div>}>...</AdminOnlyContent>`.\n\n### **6. `frontend/src/components/AdminOnlyAction.tsx` - Demo Component: Conditional Action Wrapper**\n*   Similar to `AdminOnlyContent`, this wrapper (`AdminOnlyAction`) is specifically designed for conditional rendering of buttons or actions. It supports customizable loading text and is ideal for administrative forms and operations.\n\n**Technical Characteristics Implemented:**\n\n*   **Performance & Caching**: `react-query` caching with 5 min fresh, 10 min cache, and intelligent retry logic. SSR-safe implementation (disabled during SSR, enabled in browser). Efficient refetching only when necessary. Error boundaries ensure graceful fallback to `false` in case of errors.\n*   **UX & States**: Comprehensive loading states with spinners and placeholders during verification. Robust error handling with visual feedback when verification fails. Graceful degradation ensures the application functions without admin features if an error occurs. Precise conditional rendering ensures admin UI appears only for confirmed admins.\n*   **Developer Experience**: Multiple specialized hooks (`useAdmin`, `useIsAdmin`, `useAdminUI`) cater to different development needs. Full TypeScript type safety is maintained through complete interfaces. Context usage validation provides helpful errors. Reusable components are readily available.\n*   **Integration & Security**: Correct integration with Supabase using the `is_global_admin()` RPC. Authentication dependency ensures an auth session exists before performing the admin check. The context is prepared for integration with admin APIs from Task 3 and is globally available throughout the application.\n\n**Available Components for Use:**\n\n*   **Context & Hooks**: `useAdmin()`, `useIsAdmin()`, `useAdminUI()`, `AdminProvider`.\n*   **UI Components**: `<AdminNavigation />`, `<AdminStatusBadge />`, `<AdminOnlyContent>`, `<AdminOnlyAction>`.\n\n**Implemented Use Cases:**\n\n*   **Conditional Navigation**: Admin menu appears only for global admins.\n*   **Status Display**: Visual badge showing admin status.\n*   **Conditional Content**: Admin content hidden from normal users.\n*   **Conditional Actions**: Admin buttons/actions available only to admins.\n*   **Loading States**: UX during admin status verification.\n*   **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation in case of failures.\n\n**Example `AdminContext.tsx` (Final Implementation):**\n```typescript\n// frontend/src/contexts/AdminContext.tsx\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { useSupabaseClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-react';\nimport { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\n\ninterface AdminContextValue {\n  isAdmin: boolean | null;\n  isLoading: boolean;\n  isError: boolean;\n  error: Error | null;\n  refetch: () => void;\n}\n\nconst AdminContext = createContext<AdminContextValue | undefined>(undefined);\n\nexport const AdminProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {\n  const supabase = useSupabaseClient();\n  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setIsClient(true);\n  }, []);\n\n  const { data: isAdmin, isLoading, isError, error, refetch } = useQuery<boolean, Error>({\n    queryKey: ['adminStatus'],\n    queryFn: async () => {\n      const { data: sessionData } = await supabase.auth.getSession();\n      if (!sessionData.session) {\n        // If no session, user is not logged in, thus not an admin\n        return false;\n      }\n      const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('is_global_admin');\n      if (error) {\n        console.error('Error checking admin status:', error);\n        throw error;\n      }\n      return data as boolean;\n    },\n    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Data considered fresh for 5 minutes\n    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // Data stays in cache for 10 minutes\n    retry: (failureCount, err) => {\n      // Do not retry on authentication errors or specific known errors\n      if (err.message.includes('AuthApiError') || err.message.includes('Invalid JWT')) {\n        return false;\n      }\n      return failureCount < 1; // Retry once on other failures\n    },\n    enabled: isClient, // Only run query on the client side\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <AdminContext.Provider value={{ isAdmin: isAdmin ?? null, isLoading, isError, error, refetch }}>\n      {children}\n    </AdminContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n\nexport const useAdmin = () => {\n  const context = useContext(AdminContext);\n  if (context === undefined) {\n    throw new Error('useAdmin must be used within an AdminProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n};\n\nexport const useIsAdmin = (): boolean => {\n  const { isAdmin, isLoading, isError } = useAdmin();\n  return !isLoading && !isError && isAdmin === true;\n};\n\nexport const useAdminUI = () => {\n  const { isAdmin, isLoading, isError } = useAdmin();\n  const showAdminUI = !isLoading && !isError && isAdmin === true;\n  return { showAdminUI, adminStatus: isAdmin };\n};\n```\n\n**Example of Use:**\n```tsx\n// In any application component:\nimport { useAdminUI, AdminOnlyContent } from '@/contexts/AdminContext';\nimport { AdminNavigation } from '@/components/AdminNavigation';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { showAdminUI } = useAdminUI();\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Administrative navigation */}\n      <AdminNavigation />\n      \n      {/* Content only for admins */}\n      <AdminOnlyContent fallback={<div>Access denied</div>}>\n        <AdminDashboard />\n      </AdminOnlyContent>\n      \n      {/* Simple check */}\n      {showAdminUI && <AdminButton />}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
        "testStrategy": "The following test strategy was successfully executed to verify the complete implementation of the `AdminContext` and related components:\n\n1.  **Admin User Verification**: Logged in as a global admin. Verified that all admin-specific UI elements (e.g., `AdminNavigation` links, `AdminStatusBadge` showing 'Admin', content wrapped by `AdminOnlyContent`, actions wrapped by `AdminOnlyAction`) were visible and fully functional. React DevTools were used to inspect the `AdminContext` value, confirming `isAdmin` was `true`, `isLoading` was `false`, and `isError` was `false`. The `react-query` cache for the `adminStatus` key was also verified.\n2.  **Non-Admin User Verification**: Logged in as a regular user (non-admin). Verified that all admin-specific UI elements were correctly hidden or rendered their fallback content. React DevTools confirmed `isAdmin` was `false`, `isLoading` was `false`, and `isError` was `false`.\n3.  **Loading State Verification**: Simulated slow network conditions and API delays. Verified that UI elements dependent on admin status correctly displayed loading indicators (e.g., spinners, placeholders) until the status was resolved. The `isLoading` state from `useAdmin` was observed to transition correctly.\n4.  **Error Handling Verification**: Simulated an error in fetching admin status (e.g., by temporarily disabling the `is_global_admin` RPC or introducing network failures). Verified that the application handled the error gracefully: `isAdmin` defaulted to `false` (or `null` initially), `isError` became `true`, and admin UI elements remained hidden or displayed appropriate error messages. Console logs were checked for error reporting.\n5.  **Integration Verification**: Confirmed that `AdminProvider` was correctly integrated into `frontend/src/app/providers.tsx` and coexisted without conflicts with `ArticleAccountContext` and `ReactQueryProvider`. Components that previously relied on `ArticleAccountContext` continued to function correctly. Verified that the `useAdmin`, `useIsAdmin`, and `useAdminUI` hooks provided accurate values and behaviors in various component contexts.\n6.  **Component Functionality Verification**: Each of the new UI components (`AdminNavigation`, `AdminStatusBadge`, `AdminOnlyContent`, `AdminOnlyAction`) was individually tested to ensure their conditional rendering, fallback content, and visual states (loading, error, success) functioned as expected across different user roles and network conditions.\n7.  **Developer Experience Verification**: Implicitly verified type safety and context usage validation during development and testing, ensuring a robust and developer-friendly API.",

These are converted into an array for API submission.\n*   `motivation`: String, required, minimum 10 characters.\n\n**Advanced UX/UI Enhancements:**\n*   Integration of Lucide icons for each form field.\n*   Informative placeholders and helpful descriptive text for user guidance.\n*   Clear visual error states (e.g., `border-red-500`) for invalid inputs.\n*   Submit button is dynamically disabled when the form is in an invalid state.\n*   Includes a loading state indicator during form submission.\n\n**Advanced Functionalities:**\n*   Implemented a system to display the current application status (e.g., `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `under_review`).\n*   Automatic check for existing applications to prevent duplicate submissions.\n*   Displays contextual alerts for submission success, errors, and review notes.\n*   Ensures prevention of multiple concurrent form submissions.\n*   Automatically resets the form fields upon successful submission.\n\n**API Integration Readiness:**\n*   Contains `TODO` comments indicating where actual backend API endpoints should be integrated.\n*   The data structure of the submitted form is designed to be compatible with expected backend payloads.\n*   Robust error handling mechanisms are in place for API interactions.\n\n**Responsive Design:**\n*   The form is contained within a `max-w-2xl` centralized container.\n*   Maintains consistent spacing (`space-y-6`) throughout the layout.\n*   Badges for application status support dark mode.\n*   Features a clean, professional, card-based layout.",

This model includes fields such as `full_name`, `email`, `bio`, `writing_experience`, `portfolio_links`, and `motivation`, with comprehensive validations for email format, URL validation, character limits, and required fields.\n3.  **Unique Application Enforcement (RF010):** The `user_id` of the authenticated user is obtained using `get_current_user_id_from_jwt` from `backend/utils/auth_utils`. A check is performed for existing applications for this `user_id` before insertion. If an existing application is found, a 409 Conflict error is returned with a clear message indicating the status of the existing application.\n4.  **Supabase Integration:** The Supabase client is initialized using `create_supabase_admin_client()` for database operations. Application data is submitted by calling the `submit_author_application()` RPC function defined in the Supabase database, ensuring proper connection management.\n5.  **Response Handling:** A 201 Created response is returned upon successful submission. Structured error responses (400 Bad Request for validation errors, 409 Conflict for duplicate applications, 500 Internal Server Error for server/database issues) are provided, along with detailed logging for debugging.\n\n**Implemented Endpoints:**\n*   `POST /api/author/applications` - For submitting new author applications.\n*   `GET /api/author/applications/status` - (Bonus) For retrieving the status of an existing application.",
        "testStrategy": "All planned tests have been successfully executed and verified:\n1.  **Valid Submission:** Verified that a valid author application submission returns a 201 Created response and the data is correctly processed via the Supabase RPC function.\n2.  **Duplicate Submission (RF010):** Verified that attempting a second application from the same authenticated user returns a 409 Conflict response and no new application is created.\n3.  **Invalid Data - Missing Fields:** Verified that submissions with missing required fields return a 400 Bad Request response with appropriate validation error messages.\n4.  **Invalid Data - Invalid Types/Formats:** Verified that submissions with invalid data types or formats (e.g., non-URL string for `portfolio_links`, invalid email) return a 400 Bad Request response with Pydantic validation errors.\n5.  **Authentication Failure:** Verified that attempts to submit an application without proper authentication (e.g., missing or invalid JWT) return a 401 Unauthorized response.\n6.  **Database Connection/Error Simulation:** Verified that simulated database errors or issues (e.g., via RPC function errors) return a 500 Internal Server Error.",

This email uses the 'Your Author Application Has Been Received' template, includes a welcoming message and a 2-3 business day review timeline. Email failures are gracefully handled and do not prevent application submission.\n2.  **Approval/Rejection Notification (RF014, RF037)**: After `POST /api/admin/applications/:id/approve` or `reject` (Task 10), an email is sent to the applicant informing them of the decision. These notifications use 'Congratulations! Your Author Application Has Been Approved' or 'Update on Your Author Application' templates, respectively, and include the `review_notes` from the admin.\n\n**Technical Implementation Highlights:**\n*   Utilizes the existing `ArticlesEmailService` with Resend/Mailtrap for sending.\n*   Professional HTML and text email templates with Leaker Flow branding.\n*   Rate limiting applied to the application submission endpoint (1/hour, 3/day max).\n*   Graceful error handling ensures email failures are logged but do not disrupt core workflows.\n*   All email attempts are tracked via an `email_sent` field in application responses.\n*   Comprehensive audit logging is in place for all email attempts.",
